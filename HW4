(**
   A natural number [k] is said to be _accessible_
   (with respect to the [<] relation) if every natural
   number [< k] is accessible.
 *)
Inductive acc : nat -> Prop :=
  acc_k : forall k, (forall y, y < k -> acc y) -> acc k.

(**
   In fact, every natural number is accessible with respect to
   the [<] relation, i.e., [<] is a _well founded_ relation.

   We can use the accessibility relation to define
   the strong induction principle for the natural numbers.

Definition strong_nat_ind :
  forall P : nat -> Prop,

    -> forall x, P x.

(**
   In terms of what can be proved, strong induction and
   regular induction have the same strength. In fact, we
   defined strong induction completely in terms of regular
   induction. The only difference is that strong induction
   gives us a stronger induction hypothesis, making
   proofs more convenient sometimes.

(** * Homework problems
    Instructions:
    - When appropriate, you should make use of theorems
      in this module.
    - You should gain the big picture (e.g., write an
      informal proof) before you start working on the
      Coq proof.
    - The assignment does not require esoteric tactics
      (e.g., [pattern], [refine], [fold], etc) that are
      not discussed in class.
    - Replace [Abort.] with [Qed.] after you successfully solve a problem.
    - If you can't solve a problem, comment out your code (if any) and
      end the problem with [Abort.] instead of [Qed.] In Coq, the
      syntax for comment is [(* comment goes here *)].
    - The number of submissions is unlimited.
